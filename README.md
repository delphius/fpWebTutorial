Tutorial for Free Pascal's fpWeb web application framework written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

For the diagrams, I use [PlantUML](plantuml.sourceforge.net) and sometimes [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) directly, depending on how complex the diagram is.

You can use any Markdown to whatever converter to produce a final distributable format such as HTML and PDF, but I personally use whatever [Typora](https://typora.io/) use under the hood to do so.
